# AI-Based Car Part Recommendation System

An AI-based recommendation system is a type of artificial intelligence application designed to suggest products, services, content, or information to users based on various data points. These systems analyze user behavior, preferences, and interactions to provide personalized recommendations. They are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, social media, and many other industries to enhance user experience and increase engagement.

### Key Components of an AI-Based Recommendation System

1. **Data Collection**:
    - **User Data**: Information about user demographics, preferences, purchase history, browsing history, ratings, and interactions.
    - **Item Data**: Details about the products, services, or content available, such as descriptions, categories, and features.
    - **Context Data**: Environmental factors that might influence recommendations, such as time of day, location, and device used.

2. **Data Processing**:
    - **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
    - **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from the raw data that can be used for training models.

3. **Model Building**:
    - **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.
        - **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users similar to the target user and recommends items they liked.
        - **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Finds items similar to those the target user has interacted with and recommends them.
    - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on item features.
    - **Hybrid Methods**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
    - **Deep Learning**: Uses neural networks to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions, often improving recommendation quality.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - **Training**: Using historical data to train the recommendation algorithms.
    - **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the recommendation models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error.

5. **Recommendation Generation**:
    - Generating personalized recommendations for users based on the trained models.
    - **Real-Time Recommendations**: Providing suggestions in real-time as users interact with the system.

6. **Deployment and Maintenance**:
    - **Deployment**: Integrating the recommendation system into the production environment.
    - **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the system’s performance and user feedback.
    - **Updating**: Periodically retraining models with new data to keep recommendations relevant.

### Examples of AI-Based Recommendation Systems

- **E-Commerce**: Amazon’s recommendation engine suggests products based on your purchase history and items viewed by similar users.
- **Streaming Services**: Netflix and Spotify recommend movies, TV shows, and music based on your watching and listening habits.
- **Social Media**: Facebook and Instagram suggest friends, groups, and posts based on your interactions and interests.
- **Online Advertising**: Google and Facebook ads target users with products and services they are likely to be interested in, based on their online behavior.

### Benefits of AI-Based Recommendation Systems

- **Personalization**: Offers a customized experience for each user, increasing satisfaction and engagement.
- **Increased Sales**: Drives sales by suggesting relevant products or services to users, often leading to higher conversion rates.
- **User Retention**: Keeps users engaged with the platform by continuously providing valuable and relevant recommendations.
- **Efficiency**: Helps users discover new items quickly, saving time and improving the overall user experience.

### Challenges

- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring user data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Cold Start Problem**: Difficulty in providing recommendations for new users or items with little or no data.
- **Scalability**: Handling large volumes of data and providing real-time recommendations efficiently.
- **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring the recommendation system does not reinforce existing biases and provides fair suggestions.

Overall, AI-based recommendation systems are powerful tools that leverage machine learning and data analytics to provide personalized and relevant suggestions, enhancing user experience and driving business value.









## Summary
This recommendation system is designed to provide car part recommendations based on a given keyword (e.g., a specific part name, car make, or year). The system leverages a dataset containing car parts information, which includes year, make, part name, and part name image. The dataset is stored in a MySQL database, and the recommendations are generated using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The system is implemented as a REST API using Flask, allowing users to obtain recommendations via HTTP GET requests.


## Overview
The car part recommendation system provides personalized suggestions based on user inputs, such as car make, year, or part name. This recommendation system employs a content-based filtering approach, leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate recommendations.

## Recommendation System Types
There are two primary types of recommendation systems:

### Collaborative Filtering:

User-Based: Recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.
Item-Based: Recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past.
Pros: Leverages user interactions and can discover new interests.
Cons: Requires a large amount of user data and can struggle with new users/items ("cold start" problem).

### Content-Based Filtering:

Recommends items similar to those a user has interacted with, based on item features.
Uses item metadata and user preferences.
Pros: Works well with few users and new items, and provides personalized recommendations based on item characteristics.
Cons: Limited to recommending items similar to those already interacted with and doesn't capture user behavior patterns well.
Content-Based Filtering with TF-IDF Vectorization
This system uses a content-based filtering approach due to its efficiency with textual data and flexibility with new users/items. Specifically, it utilizes:

### TF-IDF Vectorization:

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): A statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
Converts textual data (e.g., car make, year, part name) into numerical vectors that represent the importance of each term.

### Cosine Similarity:

Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors.
Determines the similarity between the input keyword vector and car parts vectors.
Outputs a similarity score indicating how closely related the items are.


### AI-Based Recommendation Logic:

Combine the text features (year, make, part name) into a single string.
Use TF-IDF to convert the combined text data into numerical vectors.
Compute the cosine similarity between the keyword vector and the car parts vectors.
Identify and return the most similar car parts based on the computed similarities.


## System Components

### Key Components
MySQL Database: Stores the car parts information in a table tbl_parts.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and loading data from the MySQL database.
TF-IDF Vectorizer: Converts text data into numerical vectors for similarity comparison.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between the keyword and the car parts data.
Flask: Provides the REST API endpoint for the recommendation system.
Pillow: Generates images for each part name, which are included in the dataset.
Steps to Build the System


### MySQL Database:

Create a MySQL database and a table named tbl_parts with columns for year, make, part name, and part name image.


### Data Preparation:

Generate a CSV file or data in part_name table containing combinations of years, makes, and part names.
Create images for each part name and save them in a directory.
Update the image paths and load it into the MySQL table tbl_parts.

### Flask REST API:

Provides an endpoint /recommend for obtaining recommendations based on a keyword.
Connects to the MySQL database and loads car parts data.
Preprocesses the data by combining text features for vectorization.
Generates recommendations using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
Returns the recommendations as a JSON response.
